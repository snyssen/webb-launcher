Webb Launcher is a minimalist starting page/personal dashboard mainly aimed at self-hosters. With its [(almost) perfect lighthouse score](#lighthouse-results) and its mobile-first responsive design, it will load fast and look great on any of your devices.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build), Webb Launcher is an homage to the [James Webb space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) and its [Ariane 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5) launcher.

## How to use

The recommended approach is with docker-compose and an accompanying .env file for your list of shortcuts:

> `docker-compose.yml` file

```yml
version: "3.3"
services:
  dashboard:
    image: ghcr.io/snyssen/webb-launcher
    env_file:
      - ./.env
    ports:
      - 80:8080
```

> `.env` file

```bash
SHORTCUTS="
- name: Development
  icon_classes: las la-laptop-code
  children:
    - name: localhost
      children:
        - name: localhost
          icon_classes: las la-user-secret
          url: http://localhost

# Optionally, you can add a OpenWeather API key so the dashboard can query weather information
# OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="xxxx"

# Optionally, you can change the search engine used by providing a base URL. The search terms are simply appended to the provided URL, so it needs to include all of the query parameters you need, e.g. for Google:
SEARCH_URL_BASE="https://www.google.be/search?q="
# The default search engine, used if this value is left unset, is DuckDuckGo
```

The launcher expects a list of shortcuts in the form of a yaml tree. The tree has a minimum depth of 2 and a maximum depth of 3. Nodes are composed of the following fields:

| Field name     | Field value                                                                                                     | Required                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | The display name for the corresponding element                                                                  | **yes**                                           |
| `icon_classes` | Classes to apply to an `<i/>` element in order to display [Line Awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) icons | no                                                |
| `url`          | An url to link to                                                                                               | Only at depth 2 and 3                             |
| `children`     | List of children for the current node                                                                           | Only at depth 1, should not be present at depth 3 |

Each depth corresponds to a different element in the dashboard:

| Depth | Impacted element  | Expected fields (bold if required, impact in parenthesis)                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | card              | **name** (title), icon_classes (icon before text), children (body of card)                                                                                                           |
| 2     | body of card      | **name** (text of the link or accordion), icon_classes (icon before text if link, or after text if accordion), children (body of accordion; *if unset, current node will be a link*) |
| 3     | body of accordion | **name** (text of the link), icon_classes (icon before text)                                                                                                                         |

The dashboard can also provide weather information based on the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org). To make use of this feature, please [Create an open weather account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and [request an API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Then, inject the API key into the container using the environment variable `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`.
